# Wordlist-Queries

This program consists of a server and client in a TCP connection. The client sends a query to the server and the server looks at each line in a wordlist.txt file to return all the words 
that match that query. An example of a query is ac*or and some of the words that match this query are activator, actor, and accelerator. Once all the words are sent, the server notifies the client.
